- Classes
	- Introduction
		- Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class <br> creates a new _type_ of object, allowing new _instances_ of that type to be made. Each class<br>  instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
		- Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
		- It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3.
	- 9.9 Generators
		- [Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They are written<br> like regular functions but use the [`yield`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield) statement whenever they want to return <br>data. Each time [`next()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next "next") is called on it, the generator resumes where it left off (it <br>remembers all the data values and which statement was last executed). An example <br>shows that generators can be trivially easy to create:
